## Introduction 

Time Square is an e-commerce site which enables customers to rent luxury watches on a price per week basis. The watches available are very expensive yet highly desireable, and would cost between €10k and €300k each to purchase from a store. Those prices make the availeble watches very difficult to obtain for the average person, and in fact for the majority of the general public. Most customers would be looking to rent a luxury watch for a special occasion, such as a wedding, holiday, honeymoon, ceremony, etc. 

The website can be viewed on Desktop, Tablet and Mobile devices.
